# OxideTerm Native GPUI Preview

This is a GPUI/native preview build for testing the next-generation OxideTerm desktop app.

If you just want the most stable daily-use OxideTerm release, do not download this preview yet. Use the current Tauri/WebView release instead. This preview exists so users can try the native UI early and report parity, packaging, terminal, SFTP, port forwarding, SSH, and AI workflow issues before it becomes the default app.

## What This Preview Is

- A native GPUI desktop build of OxideTerm.
- A preview channel, not the recommended stable channel.
- Built from the same product direction as OxideTerm: local-first remote server work over SSH, with terminal, SFTP, port forwarding, connection management, file workflows, and OxideSens AI context.
- Intended for users who are comfortable testing early builds and filing detailed issues.

## GPUI Preview 14 Highlights

This preview focuses on diagnostics, terminal workflow polish, settings cleanup, and remote SSH project detection reliability.

- Application file logging and opt-in debug logging are now available for native GPUI troubleshooting.
- SSH authentication diagnostics now include more structured debug output while continuing to avoid sensitive credential values.
- The terminal command bar now handles multiline commands and pasted command text more gracefully.
- Remote SSH directory, Git, and project detection is more resilient: repository identity is reported before slower status scans, and expensive status collection is bounded.
- Terminal settings were reorganized so local-terminal options live under the Terminal page, with improved subpage navigation and localization.
- Key and connection-related settings were consolidated to reduce duplicated configuration surfaces.
- Raw UDP profiles received fuller GPUI support and localization coverage.
- Port forwarding and terminal command handling received reliability fixes around host normalization and command construction.
- Settings, session-management dialogs, i18n strings, and the GPUI welcome/visual polish pass received additional refinements.

## What To Test

- SSH connection creation, saved connections, reconnect, known-host prompts, and jump/proxy routes.
- Telnet and serial connection creation, saved profiles, and session manager editing.
- Terminal tabs, split panes, command bar, quick commands, broadcast input, recording, and local shell behavior.
- SFTP browsing, transfers, previews, and remote file workflows.
- Local, remote, and dynamic port forwarding.
- Cloud sync setup, scope selection, upload/pull preview, conflict handling, rollback backups, and provider-specific OAuth flows.
- OxideSens AI sidebar, model/provider setup, context capture, tool calls, approval behavior, and credential redaction.
- Settings, i18n, theme rendering, keyboard shortcuts, and visual parity with the Tauri version.

## Known Preview Caveats

- This build may still have visual parity issues compared with the Tauri version.
- Some workflows may be incomplete or rough around edge cases.
- macOS builds are not notarized unless explicitly stated in a later release.
- Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may warn because this is an unsigned/early preview build.
- If a workflow is business-critical, keep the stable Tauri release installed as your fallback.

### macOS

Downloaded `.dmg` files may be quarantined by Gatekeeper. Run in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr ~/Downloads/OxideTerm_*.dmg
# or after install / 或安装后
xattr -cr /Applications/OxideTerm.app
```

### Windows

If SmartScreen warns, click **More info** -> **Run anyway**.

若 SmartScreen 弹出警告，点击 **更多信息** -> **仍要运行**。

### Linux

```bash
# AppImage
chmod +x OxideTerm_*_linux_*.AppImage && ./OxideTerm_*_linux_*.AppImage

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i OxideTerm_*_linux_*.deb && sudo apt-get install -f
```
