# OxideTerm Native GPUI Preview

This is a GPUI/native preview build for testing the next-generation OxideTerm desktop app.

If you just want the most stable daily-use OxideTerm release, do not download this preview yet. Use the current Tauri/WebView release instead. This preview exists so users can try the native UI early and report parity, packaging, terminal, SFTP, port forwarding, SSH, and AI workflow issues before it becomes the default app.

> **Final Preview notice:** This is the last GPUI Preview release. The supported upgrade path to the stable OxideTerm 2.0 release starts from an installed OxideTerm 1.x client. Preview builds will not be upgraded in place to stable 2.0. Keep or install the current 1.x client and use its upgrade flow when OxideTerm 2.0 is released.

## What This Preview Is

- A native GPUI desktop build of OxideTerm.
- A preview channel, not the recommended stable channel.
- Built from the same product direction as OxideTerm: local-first remote server work over SSH, with terminal, SFTP, port forwarding, connection management, file workflows, and OxideSens AI context.
- Intended for users who are comfortable testing early builds and filing detailed issues.

<!-- RELEASE_CHANGELOG -->

## What To Test

- SSH connection creation, saved connections, reconnect, known-host prompts, and jump/proxy routes.
- Telnet and serial connection creation, saved profiles, and session manager editing.
- Terminal tabs, split panes, command bar, quick commands, broadcast input, recording, and local shell behavior.
- SFTP browsing, transfers, previews, and remote file workflows.
- Local, remote, and dynamic port forwarding.
- Cloud sync setup, scope selection, upload/pull preview, conflict handling, rollback backups, and provider-specific OAuth flows.
- OxideSens AI sidebar, model/provider setup, context capture, tool calls, approval behavior, and credential redaction.
- Settings, i18n, theme rendering, keyboard shortcuts, and visual parity with the Tauri version.

## Known Preview Caveats

- Some workflows may be incomplete or rough around edge cases.
- macOS builds are not notarized unless explicitly stated in a later release.
- Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may warn because this is an unsigned/early preview build.
- If a workflow is business-critical, keep the stable Tauri release installed as your fallback.
